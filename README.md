## Key Features
Total Call Analysis: Displays the total number of calls received and the timestamp of the last call.
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT): Tracks the overall customer satisfaction rate at 68.07%.
Resolution Rate: Highlights the percentage of calls resolved successfully (89.94%).
Abandonment Rate: Monitors the percentage of calls abandoned (18.92%).
Performance Metrics by Agent: Detailed breakdown of total calls handled, abandonment rates, speed of answer, resolution rates, and CSAT scores for individual agents.
Satisfaction Levels: Visual representation of call counts by satisfaction levels (e.g., Normal, Satisfied, Very Satisfied).
Call Volume Analysis:
By Hour: Tracks call patterns throughout the day.
By Day: Identifies trends in call volume across days.
## Tools & Technologies
Power BI: Used for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
Data Processing: Leveraged data cleaning and transformation techniques to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Insights Gained
The average speed of answer is 67.52 seconds, and the average call handling time is 224.92 seconds.
The dashboard highlights agent-level performance, helping to identify areas for improvement.
Visual trends provide actionable insights into customer satisfaction and call abandonment rates.
Challenges & Solutions
## Data Cleaning: 
Ensured data accuracy by handling missing and inconsistent entries.
## Performance Optimization: 
Used efficient Power BI techniques to improve dashboard responsiveness.
## Outcome
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of call center operations, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to enhance performance and customer experience.
